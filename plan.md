# Project Plan: LLM Integration with Node and Python Servers

## Overview

This project will use a dual-server architecture:

- **Python Server:** Hosts the LLM (Large Language Model) and handles all AI/ML inference requests.
- **Node.js Server:** Handles authentication, user management, and acts as a bridge/proxy to the Python server for LLM-related requests.

---

## Architecture

```
[Frontend (Next.js)]
      |
      v
[Node.js Server (Auth, API)] <----> [Python Server (LLM)]
```

- The frontend communicates only with the Node.js server.
- The Node.js server manages authentication (e.g., JWT, sessions), user data, and proxies LLM requests to the Python server.
- The Python server is isolated and only accessible by the Node.js backend for security.

---

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Python Server (LLM)

- [ ] Set up a FastAPI or Flask server.
- [ ] Implement LLM inference endpoints (e.g., `/generate`, `/analyze`).
- [ ] Add input validation and error handling.
- [ ] (Optional) Add rate limiting, logging, and monitoring.

### 2. Node.js Server (Auth & Proxy)

- [ ] Set up an Express.js or similar Node.js server.
- [ ] Implement authentication (JWT, OAuth, etc.).
- [ ] Create API endpoints for the frontend (e.g., `/api/llm`, `/api/user`).
- [ ] Proxy LLM requests to the Python server and return responses to the frontend.
- [ ] Handle user sessions, permissions, and error handling.

### 3. Frontend Integration

- [ ] Update frontend to call Node.js API endpoints for LLM features.
- [ ] Handle authentication flows (login, signup, etc.).
- [ ] Display LLM responses and manage UI state.

## Security Considerations

- Only the Node.js server should communicate with the Python LLM server.
- Secure all endpoints (HTTPS, CORS, input validation).
- Store secrets and API keys securely (env variables, vaults).

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add caching for repeated LLM queries.
- Implement user roles and permissions.
- Add analytics and monitoring for LLM usage.
- Scale Python server with load balancing if needed.
